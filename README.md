# group-maker
a randomized group generator

Mildly user friendly and memory efficient, this group maker, upon first use, ccreates a directory called saved_group_lists where you can save lists of people for future use, or not. It then accepts a list of people, the size of groups, and options concerning the modulus of the number of people with respect to the group size.

On following times the user can select a previously saved list and make groups of a specified size or make a new list (and choose to save it or not).
